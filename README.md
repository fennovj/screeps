# Screeps code

This is my Screeps code. For now, just a single room.

Has auto-spawning, automatically creating extensions, creating builders only when needed, and upgrading the controller.
Also, when spawning, itconsiders all the built extensions and builds largest possible creeps with the maximum energy.

Also, I'm fairly sure the code should work if you have multiple spawners in multiple rooms, although I haven't tested it yet. For now, all units stay within their room.

No defenses yet. The main todos for now are:

* Claiming adjacent rooms
* Building defenses
* Making creeps move to other rooms when needed
* Exploring other mechanics, like factories etcetera
* Attacking other players?
